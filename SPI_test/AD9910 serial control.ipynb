    "# Serial control of AD9910 through Arduino\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control AD9910 on its official [evaluation board](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad9910.html) through a serial (3-wire SPI) connection, set the board as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Disable jumpers `W1`, `W2`, and `W4`. Remove jumpers `W3`, `W5`, `W6`.\n",
    "2. Connect the following pins to the Arduino's `reset_pin` (see below), and also to ground via a 10k pull-down resistor: in header `U9`, pins `RESET` and `EXT_PWR_DWN`; in `U5`, pin `IO_RESET`.\n",
    "3. Connect wires for the SPI interface: in header `U5`, pins `SDIO`, `SCLK`, and `CSB` should respectively be connected to the `MISO`, `SCK`, and `CS_pin`. In addition, pin `IO_update` in header `P1` should be connected to the Arduino's `IO_update_pin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above-mentioned pins have the following default values in [`SPI_test.ino`](https://github.com/js216/Arduino-codes/blob/master/SPI_test/SPI_test.ino), as appropriate for a [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_SPI.html) device:\n",
    "\n",
    "    // SCK = Clock = pin 13\n",
    "    // MOSI = Data Output = pin 11\n",
    "    // MISO = Data Input = pin 12\n",
    "    const int CS_pin = 16;\n",
    "    const int IO_update_pin = 24;\n",
    "    const int reset_pin = 2;\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since an Arduino is used as a serial-to-SPI link to interface between the computer and the AD9910, it has to be programmed appropriately. See [`SPI_test.ino`](https://github.com/js216/Arduino-codes/blob/master/SPI_test/SPI_test.ino) for example code that is assumed in the following. Other Arduino-like boards might necessitate other pin assignments; see the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI) for details, and adjust the provided [Arduino code](https://github.com/js216/Arduino-codes/blob/master/SPI_test/SPI_test.ino) as appropriate.\n",
